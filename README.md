### Welcome to the first Python Discord Game Jam!

#### The theme for this code jam is **Three-of-a-kind**.

What you do with this theme or how you interpret it is up to you, but it will be your task to come up with something fun using this theme.

#### The chosen technology for this code jam is [Arcade](https://arcade.academy/).

Arcade is a simple-to-use, modern and powerful game development framework for Python. We know that a lot of you are probably relatively new to this framework and that's why we've got the creator of Arcade, **Paul Craven**, hanging out in the **`#game-jam`** channel to help. Feel free to ask if you've got questions about Arcade!

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork this repository
Start by [forking this repository](https://github.com/python-discord/game-jam-2020/fork). If you're working as a team, only one person needs to do this.

### 2. Create a team folder in the repo
You should come up with some team name, and then create a folder in the root of this repository with your team name. **All your project files must be contained within your team's subdirectory**. If you make any changes to other teams folders or to the files in the root, we will not be able to merge your PR, and may have to disqualify your submission.

### 3. Study the guides and guidelines
We have written several documents that you should read through if you haven't done so already. These can all be accessed from the sidebar on [the main event page on our website](https://pythondiscord.com/pages/events/game-jam-2020/). The most important pages to work through can be found here:
* [Rules](https://pythondiscord.com/pages/events/game-jam-2020/rules/)
* [Judging](https://pythondiscord.com/pages/events/game-jam-2020/judging/)
* [Technical Requirements](https://pythondiscord.com/pages/events/game-jam-2020/technical-requirements/)
* [Project Setup](https://pythondiscord.com/pages/events/game-jam-2020/project-setup/)

### 4. Create a pull request
Open a pull request from your fork's `master` to the `master` branch of this repository in order to submit your project. You should use the name of your team as the name of the pull request.

### 5. Commit to your master branch
The Pull Request you created originally will be automatically updated whenever you push code to `master` on your fork, so no need for updating anything yourself or creating a new Pull Request at the end. Just keep pushing code to your `master` branch and do your best to finish before the code jam ends!

If you are working as a team, you should consider learning about feature branches so that you don't all work directly on the `master` branch and cause each other a bunch of conflicts. For a short explanation of how this works, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7YDbrS9I48).
